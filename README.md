Hi There ! 

Welcome to my team. You must be very good at your job, otherwise you wouldn't be here with me :)

This document is intended to fasten up our relationship and set expectation from early stage. Mind you that this is a living document where i'll always try to improve myself based on your feedback. 

**Disclaimer**
---
This document only applies to me and not associated to any team that i currently manage.

**About Me**
---
In case you are curious, my [MBTI personality is INFJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality). I highly suggest you to take that personality assessment so you know yourself better, and don't forget to share it to me so i can know you better as well. 

Most of my day is spent collecting, filtering and sharing context/information from across other projects, domains, people, and product lines. I'll try to push information to you as much as I can but feel free to ask about anything else. 

**If You Need Anything**
---
My availability might looks scary, most of the time you might find that i don't have any slots on my calendar, but I'm here for you. If you find free time on my calendar, please schedule something right away. You can contact me literally anytime even on the weekend or even midnight. I always try to responds quickly. I might message you things, but unless i says its urgent, it can always wait until Monday. 

**My Values & Philosophy**
---
*   **People First** \
I always believe that people is the top ingredient for successfulness of the company. Having great people & great culture will end up with great products. My personal focus would be to optimize process and the way people works so they can be the best of what they can be.

*   **Transparency** \
No company will be able to require me to lie to you and it could never happen as would not abide that thing. Expect that i will always say the truth to you, but there will be times when company require me to not tell something before a certain date ( e.g. New Title Appointment to certain person, strategic-position person whos going to leave ) \

*   **No Leader is Always Right** \
I believe that there is no silver-bullet for leadership, no one will ever 100% right. I expect that we will have continuous feedback on each other. It could be something that you think i screwed up, i could do better, or even things that you think i don't want to hear it - please, i do want to hear it. 


*   **Big Haters of "It will be done, when it's done"** \
I will always try to give dates and ETA in my every actions and i expect you will do the same. If you don't know when it's done, then tell me honestly so we can figure it out together. 

*   **Ownership** \
I always own everything that assigned to me as my own thing by understanding on why i need to do it and why i need to do it by <duedate_here>. This thinking helps me to bring the best out of me. If you don't know why you are doing particular task please ask, least thing i want is you are doing something just because i said so.
*   **Being [Husnuzan](http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_6_April_2014/10.pdf)** \
Trust is something that i will give it on the first time, especially for people whos reporting to me. However, to lead people means that i need to put positive assumption on everything that happened. This will help me to see silver-linings on everythings, embrace psychological safety environment, and focus to learn on mistakes.

**My expectations for you**
---
We are going to have 1:1 every week at least 30 minute except during high-pressure week ( e.g. Audit, Critical Incidents ), we will revisit whether we can change it to bi-weekly but i'd like to keep us having overcommunicate. You will also get update from me on what im currently doing, problems that i have, and updates from greater org or company - if i'm not sharing any of these, please let me know because i might be too focus on other points.

Please proactively tell me anything if you sense something is off about your team, other team, other individual, or something else that might be a major concern. If you have doubt whether you need to tell me or not, please tell me right away, overcommunicate better than sorry.

Please always try to educate yourself with software engineering fundamentals and latest technology. We know that technology always evolve, but in the end as long as you have a really solid fundamentals you will not have difficulties to catch up on anything.

Always build a network to yourself with [Habluminannas](http://hrmars.com/hrmars_papers/The_Application_of_Habluminallah_and_Habluminannas_in_the_Work_Motivation_of_the_Management.pdf) in mind, believe me that having new peers and involve in community will broaded your mind and will push you to constantly learning something new. I'm more than happy to help you find new peers or community that might fit for your goals and career aspiration.

If you are a people manager - please read below : 

Ensure that you have a weekly 1:1s with your direct reports. Make sure you are explicit about your direct reports career plan, feedback, share any context / updates from org or company that you have which i will always try to share with you, and make sure you coach them through any problems that they have.

Please continue to improve yourself on management skill by attending conferences, leadership or development workshops, learn from other peers. Being people manager is one tricky things, you need to constantly learn from others as people change dynamically overtime and they have different way to handle.

Lastly, please promote worklife balance & harmony to you and your team. Take vacation, do your hobbies and please ensure that you are doing any sports. I strongly believe that people whos able to maintain their worklife balance is fall into [smart & get things](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385) done person type.

Expect that i will have skip-level 1:1s with your direct reports to get sense on whats happening on the ground and keeping my intrapersonal relationship with them.

**Meetings**
---
Its always easy to be trapped in meeting hells, that is something that i always try to avoid and you should do that too. I might rejecting your meeting invitation if i feels like i will not have any contribution, but please keep me in the loop on the MoM. I'd like to ensure that every meeting have agendas in the invitation, and clear distinction on whos the one facilitating and the one that leading the meetings. Always try to make meeting short, i usually use 25 - 50 - 80 minutes as my meetings length and we should never have meeting longer than 80 minutes.
